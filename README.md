##### **Turtle API is an package that gets a random turtle picture and posts it to your server!**

#####  **You can also just call the package to get a random turtle image.**

### Note
⚠️ Turtle API used to be called "Discord-turtle" and used as a util package for discord like playing games. Discord Turtle had no use after I created a new and better package called [Discord.js-util](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discord.js-util) and [Discord.jsh](https://www.npmjs.com/package/discordjsh) so I changed this package into a turtle API!

⚠️ You can still find the old package in the "old" branch!
# Install
```shell
# NPM
npm i turtle-api
# Yarn
yarn add turtle-api
```
